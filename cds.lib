# This is a default cds.lib file. It was automatically created
# by the ddCreateLib function.
# This file is a template for your own private
# cds.lib file that you will use in this workarea.  This file
# is never checked in (in fact there is a policy in place to
# prevent it from being checked in.)  This file is meant to 
# act as a starting point for accessing library data and
# as a temporary holding place for local libraries that
# you create.  Once you decide to check a library in you
# will move the definition of that library (DEFINE statement) 
# from this file to the project.lib file.  The project.lib
# file should be checked out, modified with the cdsLibEditor,
# and then checked back in.
# 
# At the start, this file has one entry and that is used
# to read in the project's project.lib file.
